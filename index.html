          Most people buying a DNA kit in 2025 do three things: search on Amazon, get overwhelmed,
          and then pick whatever has the most reviews. Genectics.com exists to make that decision less random –
          and to explain when a direct specialist provider like LivingDNA makes more sense.

      <h2 id="livingdna-heading" class="section-title">LivingDNA – specialist for British & regional ancestry</h2>

      <p>
        While most of the kits we compare above are available on Amazon, <strong>LivingDNA</strong> is a
        specialist provider sold directly through their own website. It is built for people who care less
        about giant cousin networks and more about <strong>deep, regional ancestry detail</strong> – especially
        for those with British or Irish roots, or from countries within the UK and nearby regions.
      </p>

      <ul class="hero-list">
        <li>Focuses heavily on <strong>fine-grained regional ancestry breakdowns</strong>.</li>
        <li>Particularly strong if your ancestry is <strong>UK-heavy, Irish, or British diaspora</strong>.</li>
        <li>Offers ancestry reports plus optional wellness and traits insights.</li>
        <li>Sold directly via LivingDNA – not via Amazon – which is why it is shown in its own section.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="hero-highlight" style="margin-top: 12px;">
        In simple terms: if you mainly want a first, affordable DNA kit and easy shopping, start with one of
        the Amazon kits above. If you already know you care a lot about <strong>UK-specific ancestry</strong>,
        <strong>LivingDNA</strong> is often the smarter specialist choice.

    <section class="card faq" aria-labelledby="faq-heading" style="margin-top: 24px;">
      <h2 id="faq-heading" class="section-title">DNA kit FAQ</h2>

      <h3>Will these kits tell me everything about my health?</h3>
      <p>
        No. Consumer DNA tests are not a substitute for medical diagnostics. They can highlight traits,
        risks or interesting patterns – but you should always discuss health decisions with a doctor.
      </p>

      <h3>Is my DNA safe with these companies?</h3>
      <p>
        Each provider has its own privacy policy and data-sharing rules. Before you buy, read their latest
        terms on their website and decide what you’re comfortable with. Our
        <a href="guide.html">safety guide</a> walks through what to look for.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I use more than one DNA service?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Many enthusiasts start with one kit, then either upload their raw data to other platforms
        or order extra tests later for deeper ancestry or health insights.
      </p>

      <h3>Is LivingDNA better for British or UK-focused ancestry?</h3>
      <p>
        Often, yes. If a big part of your family story runs through the UK or Ireland and you care more about
        <strong>regional detail</strong> than massive cousin networks, LivingDNA is one of the strongest
        specialist options. We cover it in a dedicated section above –
