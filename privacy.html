      <h1>Privacy &amp; Cookies</h1>
      <p>
        This page explains what kind of information is collected when you use Genectics.com,

      </p>
      <p>
        The site is operated by <strong>ronarn AS</strong>, a Norwegian company that runs
        educational and comparison websites in health, genetics and personal finance.

      <h2>2. Analytics &amp; usage data</h2>
      <p>
        Like most websites, Genectics.com uses privacy-friendly analytics to understand how

        <li>Device type (desktop, tablet, mobile) and anonymised technical details</li>

        <li>Referring sources (for example, search engines or other websites)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Analytics data is used in aggregate form to see which guides and comparison tables are useful
        and where visitors struggle to find what they need.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
