      <h1>About Genectics.com</h1>
      <p>
        Genectics.com is an independent comparison site focused on at-home DNA test kits:
        ancestry, health &amp; wellness, family matching and specialised tests.
        Our goal is to make it easier to choose a kit based on your actual goal,
        not on hype or paid rankings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site is published and operated by <strong>ronarn AS</strong>, a Norwegian
        company that runs a network of educational and comparison websites in health,
        genetics and personal finance.

      <h2>How our comparisons work</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We review publicly available information from each provider.</li>
        <li>We compare ancestry detail, family matching tools, health / wellness features,
            price and ongoing subscription requirements.</li>
        <li>Editorial “star ratings” are relative and for comparison only,
            not clinical evaluations.</li>
        <li>Providers cannot pay to change scores or rankings.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Whenever we update a table or rating, it is based on new documentation,
        pricing changes, or product updates – not on sponsorships.
