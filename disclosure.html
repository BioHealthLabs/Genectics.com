      <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
      <p>
        Genectics.com is an independent comparison site focused on at-home DNA test kits
        for ancestry, family matching and health &amp; wellness. To keep the site free to use,
        we sometimes earn money when you buy products through links on our pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page explains how that works, who we work with, and how we protect editorial
        independence when affiliate links are involved.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>1. How this site makes money</h2>
      <p>
        Some links on Genectics.com are <strong>affiliate links</strong>. If you click one of
        these links and then buy a product, we may receive a small commission from the merchant
        at no extra cost to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main affiliate relationships currently used on Genectics.com include, but are not
        limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Living DNA via the CJ affiliate network</li>
        <li>DNA test kits and related products sold on Amazon</li>
        <li>Other DNA and health kit merchants via affiliate networks such as CJ, Impact and Awin</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These commissions help cover hosting, maintenance and editorial work without charging
        visitors a subscription fee.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>2. No paid rankings or sponsored reviews</h2>
      <p>
        Our comparisons and descriptions are created using publicly available information,
        documentation from providers and our own editorial framework. We do
        <strong>not</strong> sell rankings or “featured placement” to DNA companies.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Providers cannot pay to be included in a table.</li>
        <li>Providers cannot pay to be ranked higher than competitors.</li>
        <li>Providers cannot pay to change our editorial notes or star ratings.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If a brand offers us special marketing materials, pre-written copy or paid placements,
        we either decline or clearly label such content outside of the comparison framework.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>3. How we label affiliate links</h2>
      <p>
        Where practical, affiliate links are clearly labelled or placed in obvious
        “View offer”, “Buy kit” or “Visit provider” buttons. On some pages we may also
        explicitly mark affiliate relationships in text, for example:
        <em>“We may earn a commission if you buy via this link.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If a section or table is heavily driven by affiliate-supported products, this is
        explained in the surrounding text so you understand the commercial context.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>4. Impact on ratings and recommendations</h2>
      <p>
        We always try to align our editorial priorities with what is useful for readers:
        clarity, value, and realistic expectations about what a kit can and cannot do.
        Affiliate commissions do not override this.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Star ratings are relative and based on category performance, not payouts.</li>
        <li>We may list competing products that pay little or no commission if they make sense for certain users.</li>
        <li>We may choose to highlight a kit with a lower commission if we believe it is a better fit for a common use case.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If a conflict of interest is unavoidable (for example, an affiliate partner
        is also a major player in a category), we aim to surface that context directly
        in the text.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Relationship to the broader publisher network</h2>
      <p>

        published by <strong>ronarn AS</strong>. The overarching governance, ethics and
        independence standards are described on:
