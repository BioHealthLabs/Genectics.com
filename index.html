        <h2>Deep Dive 1: AncestryDNA — The Genealogy Powerhouse</h2>
        <p>If your primary goal is to discover family connections, trace your lineage, or build a multi-generation family tree, then AncestryDNA stands far above the competition.</p>
        
        <h3>Why AncestryDNA dominates genealogy</h3>
        <p><strong>1. The world’s largest DNA-matching database:</strong> AncestryDNA has tested over 22+ million people, giving you the highest chance of finding biological relatives — from close cousins to distant ancestral matches.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Seamless family-tree integration:</strong> Ancestry uniquely allows you to connect your DNA results directly to detailed family trees. The platform can hint, auto-match, and expand your tree using billions of historical records.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Historical document connections:</strong> Ancestry’s core strength comes from its archive: Birth and death certificates, Immigration and travel documents, Census records, Military archives, Marriage and church records. This gives you not just DNA matches, but real historical context, which makes your ancestry story far more complete.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Best for adoptees and genealogists:</strong> Those searching for biological parents or constructing detailed lineage charts consistently report better results with AncestryDNA.</p>

        <h3>Who should choose AncestryDNA?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Anyone building a family tree</li>
            <li>Anyone searching for relatives</li>
            <li>Adoptees looking for biological connections</li>
            <li>Genealogy enthusiasts</li>

        <h2>Deep Dive 2: 23andMe — The Health Insights Leader</h2>

        <p><strong>1. FDA-authorized health reports:</strong> 23andMe offers dozens of health-related insights that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration — something AncestryDNA does not offer. These include: Risk reports for certain genetic conditions, Carrier status for inherited disorders, Pharmacogenetics (how your body responds to medications), Wellness factors (sleep, diet, fitness, etc.). This is clinical-grade data that can be genuinely useful in conversations with your doctor.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Highly accurate ancestry percentages:</strong> While AncestryDNA is the genealogy king, 23andMe still provides extremely detailed ancestry breakdowns, including: Regional ancestry, Maternal (mtDNA) haplogroup, Paternal (Y-DNA) haplogroup, Neanderthal percentage.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Best app and user interface:</strong> The 23andMe app and dashboard are clean, modern, and built for non-technical users. Complex data is broken into simple, actionable insights.</p>
