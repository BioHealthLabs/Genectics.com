      <h3>Will these kits tell me everything about my health?</h3>
      <p>
        No. Consumer DNA tests are not a substitute for medical diagnostics. They can highlight traits,
        risks or interesting patterns – but you should always discuss health decisions with a doctor.
      </p>

      <h3>Is my DNA safe with these companies?</h3>
      <p>
        Each provider has its own privacy policy and data-sharing rules. Before you buy, read their latest
        terms on their website and decide what you’re comfortable with. Our
        <a href="guide.html">safety guide</a> walks through what to look for.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I use more than one DNA service?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Many enthusiasts start with one kit, then either upload their raw data to other platforms
        or order extra tests later for deeper ancestry or health insights.
