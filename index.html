        <h2>New to DNA testing?</h2>
        <p>
          Start with a simple ancestry-first kit like Living DNA, MyHeritage DNA or AncestryDNA.
          Our beginner guide walks you through what to expect, how to read your results and
          how to avoid common regrets.

        <h2>Already own raw DNA data?</h2>
        <p>
          If you already tested elsewhere, you may be able to upload your raw DNA file to
          other services for more insights instead of buying a brand new kit.

      <h2 id="faq-heading" class="section-title">DNA kit FAQ</h2>

      <h3>Will these kits tell me everything about my health?</h3>
      <p>
        No. Consumer DNA tests are not a substitute for medical diagnostics. They can highlight traits,
        risks or interesting patterns – but you should always discuss health decisions with a doctor.
      </p>

      <h3>Is my DNA safe with these companies?</h3>
      <p>
        Each provider has its own privacy policy and data-sharing rules. Before you buy, read their latest
        terms on their website and decide what you’re comfortable with. Our
        <a href="guide.html">safety guide</a> walks through what to look for.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I use more than one DNA service?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Many enthusiasts start with one kit, then either upload their raw data to other platforms
        or order extra tests later for deeper ancestry or health insights.
