            Consumer DNA kits are popular because they feel like a shortcut to “answers”.
            But there are multiple types of DNA tests, different privacy trade-offs, and a lot of marketing noise.
            This guide explains the basics in plain language — so you can choose a kit based on your real goal.

      <section class="card" aria-labelledby="how-heading">
        <h2 id="how-heading" class="section-title">How at-home DNA kits work (in simple terms)</h2>

        <p>
          Most consumer kits use a saliva sample (or cheek swab). The lab extracts DNA, runs it through a testing process,
          and produces a dataset that is compared against reference populations and/or scientific associations.
        </p>

        <h3>What is actually being “measured”?</h3>
        <p>
          Most mainstream consumer kits analyze a large set of known genetic markers rather than sequencing every letter of your genome.
          That’s enough for ancestry estimates and many trait-style reports, but it has limitations — especially for clinical conclusions.
        </p>

        <h3>Why do results differ between companies?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Different reference databases:</strong> ancestry estimates depend heavily on who is in the dataset.</li>
          <li><strong>Different algorithms:</strong> companies model populations and traits differently.</li>
          <li><strong>Different reporting choices:</strong> some providers focus on depth in one area, others focus on breadth.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" aria-labelledby="reliability-heading">
        <h2 id="reliability-heading" class="section-title">What DNA kits can tell you reliably — and what they can’t</h2>

        <h3>Usually reliable (when interpreted correctly)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Close family matching</strong> (parents, siblings, close cousins) — assuming the provider has a strong matching network.</li>
          <li><strong>Broad ancestry signals</strong> (continental / large-region patterns) — more reliable than small sub-regions.</li>
          <li><strong>Some well-studied markers</strong> tied to traits (varies widely by report quality).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Often misunderstood or over-marketed</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Exact ethnicity percentages</strong> as if they were precise measurements.</li>
          <li><strong>“Health risk” as diagnosis</strong> (risk ≠ disease).</li>
          <li><strong>Wellness reports</strong> framed as medical advice.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="hero-highlight" style="margin-top: 12px;">
          DNA reports can be interesting and useful, but they are not a substitute for medical diagnostics.
          If a result worries you, confirm through a qualified healthcare professional.

      <section class="card" aria-labelledby="privacy-heading">
        <h2 id="privacy-heading" class="section-title">The real trade-off: convenience vs privacy</h2>

        <p>
          If you care about privacy, the question is not only “is the kit accurate?” but also:
          <strong>what happens to your genetic data over time?</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>Key privacy questions to ask before you buy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>How long is your DNA data stored, and can you delete it?</li>
          <li>Does the company share data with partners or for research (and is it opt-in)?</li>
          <li>Can you download raw data — and what are the risks if you upload it elsewhere?</li>
          <li>Do they allow relative matching by default (and do you want that)?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>

      <section class="card" aria-labelledby="choose-heading">
        <h2 id="choose-heading" class="section-title">How to choose your first DNA kit (fast decision framework)</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Pick your primary goal</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ancestry + relatives</strong> → start with an ancestry-first kit.</li>
          <li><strong>Wellness-style insights</strong> → consider a wellness-focused provider.</li>
          <li><strong>Paternity / relationship confirmation</strong> → use a dedicated relationship test (often with legal options).</li>
          <li><strong>European/UK regional ancestry</strong> → choose a provider known for that depth.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 2: Decide your privacy tolerance</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If you want <strong>relative matching</strong>, accept that you’re joining a network (and your data may connect you to others).</li>
          <li>If you want <strong>minimal data exposure</strong>, choose providers and settings that reduce sharing and allow deletion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 3: Don’t overpay on kit #1</h3>
        <p>
          Most people learn what they actually want only after seeing their first results.
          It is often smarter to start with one strong kit, then expand later (or upload raw data to additional services if appropriate).

        <h2 id="faq-heading" class="section-title">FAQ</h2>

        <h3>Is consumer DNA testing accurate?</h3>
        <p>
          It depends on the category. Close-family matching can be strong, broad ancestry signals are often useful,
          but small regional ethnicity percentages and many wellness insights are more uncertain.
        </p>

        <h3>Can a DNA kit diagnose disease?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Consumer DNA tests are not medical diagnostics. Some markers may indicate elevated risk, but clinical confirmation is required.
        </p>

        <h3>Should I buy a “health” or “wellness” DNA kit first?</h3>
        <p>
          If you are unsure, start with ancestry-first for the broadest value. If your only goal is lifestyle-style insights,
          a wellness-focused test may make more sense — but treat results as informational, not medical decisions.
        </p>

        <h3>What’s the biggest privacy risk?</h3>
        <p>
          Long-term retention and secondary use of genetic data. Read provider policies, use privacy settings,
          and think carefully before uploading raw DNA to third parties.
