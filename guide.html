            <h1>7 Things You Must Know Before Buying a DNA Kit</h1>
            
            <p>Privacy concerns have become the #1 topic for DNA testing — and for good reason. When you test with LivingDNA, MyHeritage, AncestryDNA, or 23andMe, you aren’t just buying a product; you’re sharing the most personal data you possess.</p>
            <p>Below are the 7 most important things to understand in 2025 — written to help you choose the safest company, not the biggest one.</p>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> *Please ensure the final CSS styles (provided in previous turns) are copied into the **style** tag of this document and all other legal pages for consistent look.*</p>

            <h2>1. Who Owns Your DNA? (Short Answer: You Do — But Not Equally)</h2>
            <p>All companies say you own your DNA. But what they can legally do with it varies dramatically.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>LivingDNA:</strong> Best privacy. No pharma partnerships, no data selling, no law-enforcement cooperation, and strict UK privacy standards.</li>
                <li><strong>MyHeritage:</strong> Strong privacy. No police access and Israel/EU-based privacy protections.</li>
                <li><strong>23andMe:</strong> Lowest privacy rating. Large pharma partnerships and revenue from anonymized genetic licensing.</li>
                <li><strong>AncestryDNA:</strong> Does not sell data, but may cooperate with law enforcement with a court order.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="cta-box">
                <strong>If privacy matters most: choose LivingDNA or MyHeritage.</strong>
            </div>

            <h2>2. Can Police Access Your DNA?</h2>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Company</th>
                        <th>Police Access?</th>
                        <th>Notes</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr><td>LivingDNA</td><td>❌ Never</td><td>Strongest anti-law-enforcement stance</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>MyHeritage</td><td>❌ Never</td><td>Very consumer-protective</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>AncestryDNA</td><td>✔ With court order</td><td>Transparent, but allows access</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>23andMe</td><td>✔ In rare cases</td><td>Legally required only</td></tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>Again: LivingDNA & MyHeritage are the safest choices for data security.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Cybersecurity: Who Protects Your Data Best?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>LivingDNA:</strong> Smaller database → less attractive to hackers. Strong UK cybersecurity rules.</li>
                <li><strong>MyHeritage:</strong> Good security; previous breach was email-only, not DNA.</li>
                <li><strong>AncestryDNA & 23andMe:</strong> Largest databases → biggest targets. Costs: higher risk of mass-scale exposure.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>4. What Happens to Your DNA Sample?</h2>
            <p><strong>LivingDNA</strong> destroys physically faster than others. <strong>MyHeritage</strong> destroys on request. <strong>23andMe</strong> and <strong>AncestryDNA</strong> store samples unless asked to destroy them.</p>

            <h2>5. What Results Affect Family Members?</h2>
            <p><strong>LivingDNA</strong> produces the least controversial relative matches since its database is smaller and privacy-focused. <strong>AncestryDNA & MyHeritage</strong> produce more matches, which may reveal surprise relatives, unknown parents, or unexpected heritage.</p>

            <h2>6. Are Health Reports Accurate?</h2>
            <p><strong>23andMe</strong> remains the leader. <strong>LivingDNA</strong> focuses on ethnicity. <strong>MyHeritage Health</strong> exists, but is limited. <strong>AncestryDNA</strong> discontinued health reports.</p>

            <h2>7. Hidden Consent Settings You MUST Review</h2>
            <p>All companies have hidden toggles for: research, pharma partnerships, DNA matching, sample storage, and third-party data use. The safest defaults: LivingDNA. The least safe defaults: 23andMe.</p>

            <div class="cta-box">
                <strong>Final Recommendation (Trust & Safety)</strong><br>
                If your priority is Privacy, Accurate ethnicity, No data selling, and Zero police access, then the DNA test with the strongest consumer protection is:
